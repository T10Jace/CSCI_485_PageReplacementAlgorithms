## Page Replacement Algorithms
There are two folders containing files, labled as:
1. Low Frame
2. High Frame

## Low Frame
The folder labeled "Low_Frame", contains the files LRU.cpp and SecondChance.cpp

SecondChance.cpp is the code for the Second Chance Page Replacement Algorithm for 3 frames.
    Run the Following to execute and run:
            g++ SecondChance.cpp -o SecondChance
            g++ -c SecondChance.cpp
            ./SecondChance


LRU.cpp is the code for the Second Chance Page Replacement Algorithm for 3 frames.
    Run the Following to execute and run:
            g++ LRU.cpp -o LRU
            g++ -c LRU.cpp
            ./LRU


## High Frame
The folder labeled "High_Frame", also contains the files LRU.cpp and SecondChance.cpp
    Run the following to enter the file:
        cd High_Frame/

SecondChance.cpp is the code for the Second Chance Page Replacement Algorithm for 6 frames.
    Run the Following to execute and run:
        g++ SecondChance.cpp -o SecondChance
        g++ -c SecondChance.cpp
        ./SecondChance
        

LRU.cpp is the code for the Second Chance Page Replacement Algorithm for 6 frames.
    Run the Following to execute and run:
            g++ LRU.cpp -o LRU
            g++ -c LRU.cpp
            ./LRU


# NOTE

* All files have the same page numbers as reference string in a vector.
* The page numbers are as follows: 0, 2, 1, 4, 3, 5, 1, 6, 2, 1, 4, 7, 0, 7, 8
